# Support Request for the Gitaly Team

<!--

The goal of this template is to create a consistent experience for customer support requests from the Gitaly Team. Due to the size of the team and ambitious amount of work we try to complete, it helps us tremendously to have a common issue format for requests that can be prioritized appropriately. It also helps keep a record of issues experienced that can benefit other teams in the future.

As we collaborate on resolution of this issue, the Gitaly team will attempt to utilize this as a single source of truth.

-->

_The goal is to keep these requests public. However, if customer information is required to the support request, please be sure to mark this issue as confidential._

This request template is part of [Gitaly Team's intake process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/systems/gitaly/#how-to-contact-the-team).

### Severity

<!-- Please be as realistic as possible here. We are sensitive to the fact that customers are frustrated when things aren't working, but realistically we cannot treat everything as a Severity 1 emergency.

For a good rule of thumb, please refer to the bug prioritization framework located in the handbook here: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#severity

For S1 or S2 issues, please follow https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/systems/gitaly/#urgent-issues-and-outages .
